# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

- The approach was to use JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve earthquake coordinates and magnitudes from GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map via an API request to create interactivity for the earthquake data.

- Pop-up markers were included to show the exact location and magnitude of the earthquake.

- The markers are adjusted according to the magnitude of the earthquake, the size and color change according to the earthquake data.

- A legend with the scale of the earthquake size is displayed.
